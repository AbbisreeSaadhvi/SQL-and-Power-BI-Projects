# SQL-and-Power-BI-Projects
**Overview:**

This repository contains SQL scripts and PowerBI dashboards for HR and Payroll analysis. The goal of these projects is to provide insights into various aspects of HR and payroll management, such as identifying missing and duplicate payments, payments after termination, travel payments during public holidays, and bonus calculations based on performance.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of two main tables:

_Employees:_
Contains information about employees, including their IDs, names, positions, dates of joining and termination, and performance scores.

_Payments:_
Contains information about payments made to employees, including payment IDs, employee IDs, payment dates, amounts, and payment types.

Additionally, a PublicHolidays table is used to flag travel payments made during public holidays.
